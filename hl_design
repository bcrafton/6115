  1) duplication - you duplicate based on #MAC per layer.
  2) rows per array - this can be computed optimally, but we are just going to hard code it.
> there is NO way to fit ALL layers into a single PE.
> NEED to pick some partition size within the array -> how you size the fmap packet, don't kill zero skipping.
